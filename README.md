# Climate Change Impact on Agriculture

## Project Description
This project aims to analyze and visualize the impact of climate change on agriculture across various countries and crop types. The comprehensive dashboard includes several key metrics and visualizations:

### Crop Types
The left side of the dashboard lists various crop types such as Barley, Coffee, Corn, Cotton, Fruits, Rice, Soybeans, Sugarcane, Vegetables, and Wheat. This categorization allows for a detailed analysis of how different crops are affected by climate change.

### Forecasting Extreme Weather Events by Year
A line graph in the top center of the dashboard shows the forecasted number of extreme weather events from 1990 to 2030. The graph indicates fluctuations in the number of events, with notable peaks in certain years (e.g., 1546 in 1998, 1637 in 2015).

### Soil Health Index by Country
A world map on the top right highlights the soil health index across different countries. Countries are color-coded to represent varying levels of soil health, providing a geographical perspective on soil conditions.

### Soil Health Index by Country (Detailed)
A donut chart at the bottom left breaks down the soil health index by country, including Australia, China, USA, India, Nigeria, Argentina, Canada, and France. Each segment of the chart represents the soil health index percentage for each country.

### Economic Impact (Million USD) by Country
A line graph in the bottom center shows the economic impact of climate change on agriculture in million USD for various countries. The graph indicates a descending trend from Nigeria (720K) to Brazil (637K).

### Extreme Weather Events by Country
Another donut chart at the bottom right displays the percentage of extreme weather events by country, including the USA, Nigeria, Australia, Argentina, Canada, China, India, and Brazil.
